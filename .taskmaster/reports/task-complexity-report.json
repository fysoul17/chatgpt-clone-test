		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Initial Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Project Setup and Initial Configuration' task into subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Initializing the Next.js 15 project with the App Router and TypeScript. 2. Integrating Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, including theme configuration (e.g., color palette). 3. Creating and configuring the `.env.local` file with placeholder variables for Supabase and OpenAI.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is low as it primarily involves following documented setup procedures. However, it consists of three distinct configuration stages: the core framework, the UI/styling layer, and environment-specific secrets. Separating them into subtasks ensures each foundational piece is correctly established and verifiable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema and Supabase Setup",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Database Schema and Supabase Setup' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Writing and executing the SQL script to create the `conversations` and `messages` tables with appropriate columns and foreign key constraints. 2. Enabling and defining the Row Level Security (RLS) policies for both tables to ensure user data isolation. 3. Adding necessary database indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns for performance.",
			"reasoning": "While the SQL for table creation may be straightforward, implementing Row Level Security correctly requires a good understanding of database security principles and Supabase's auth model. Breaking it down separates schema definition, security implementation, and performance optimization into logical, testable steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "User Authentication Flow",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'User Authentication Flow' task into subtasks. The subtasks should cover: 1. Creating the UI pages/components for the sign-up and sign-in forms. 2. Implementing the client-side logic using the Supabase client library to handle user registration and login API calls. 3. Creating Next.js middleware to protect dashboard routes and handle redirects for unauthenticated users. 4. Implementing the sign-out functionality, including a UI element and the logic to clear the user session.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it spans the full stack: frontend UI, client-side logic, and server-side middleware for routing. Each part is critical for a secure and functional auth system. Separating UI, client logic, middleware, and sign-out creates clear boundaries and simplifies development and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Core UI Layout and Chat Interface",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Core UI Layout and Chat Interface' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Building the main dashboard layout component (`/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`) with a sidebar and a main content area. 2. Developing the chat message input component, including the multi-line textarea with custom key handling (Enter vs. Shift+Enter) and conditional button disabling. 3. Creating the message list component that uses a scroll area and renders messages with distinct styling and alignment for 'user' and 'assistant' roles.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant UI development with stateful, interactive components. The complexity comes from component composition and specific interaction logic (e.g., textarea behavior). Decomposing it into the overall layout, the input control, and the display area aligns with a component-based architecture."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "OpenAI Streaming API Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'OpenAI Streaming API Endpoint' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Setting up the POST route handler at `/api/chat/route.ts` and implementing input validation for the request body. 2. Integrating the logic to fetch conversation history from the database to provide context for the AI model. 3. Implementing the core logic to call the OpenAI API and stream the response back to the client using the Vercel AI SDK and a `ReadableStream`.",
			"reasoning": "The primary complexity here is not the OpenAI call itself, but correctly implementing the streaming response, which is a departure from standard JSON request-response cycles. Separating input handling, data fetching for context, and the core streaming logic isolates the most complex part of the task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Client-Side AI Integration and State Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Client-Side AI Integration and State Management' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Setting up and configuring a client-side state management library (e.g., TanStack Query) for the chat. 2. Implementing the form submission handler that triggers the API call and performs an optimistic update for the user's message. 3. Writing the client-side logic to consume the `ReadableStream` from the API response and append tokens to the UI in real-time. 4. Managing the complete UI state, including showing a loading indicator while awaiting the stream and handling potential API errors.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks, as it involves advanced frontend concepts: optimistic updates, handling streaming data on the client, and sophisticated state management. Breaking it down isolates the setup, the initial action (optimistic update), the core stream handling, and the surrounding state management (loading/error)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Conversation and Message Persistence",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Conversation and Message Persistence' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Modifying the API to check for an existing conversation or create a new one in the database on the first message. 2. Implementing the logic to save the user's message to the `messages` table immediately upon receipt in the API handler. 3. Implementing the logic to save the complete AI-generated response to the `messages` table after the entire response stream has been generated and sent.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in orchestrating database writes around the streaming API call. The user message, AI response, and potential new conversation are all created at different points in the request's lifecycle. Subtasks should reflect this temporal separation to ensure data integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Conversation History and Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Conversation History and Navigation' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Implementing server-side data fetching in the main layout to retrieve and render the user's conversation history in the sidebar. 2. Creating the dynamic page `app/chat/[conversationId]/page.tsx` to serve as the container for individual conversation views. 3. Implementing data fetching on the dynamic page to load and display all messages for the selected conversation, using the `conversationId` from the URL.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves building a standard list-detail UI pattern within the Next.js App Router. The complexity is moderate, involving data fetching in both a shared layout (server component) and a dynamic page. Separating the list view (sidebar) from the detail view (main page) is a natural division of work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Conversation Deletion",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Conversation Deletion' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Adding a delete option (e.g., in a dropdown menu) and a confirmation dialog to the conversation list UI. 2. Creating a new API route handler (`DELETE /api/conversations/[id]`) to process the deletion request and remove the conversation from the database. 3. Implementing the client-side logic to trigger the deletion on confirmation, handle the API call, and optimistically or imperatively update the UI by removing the conversation from the list.",
			"reasoning": "This is a small, self-contained full-stack feature. The complexity is low-to-moderate. Breaking it down into UI (the user action), API (the backend logic), and client-side state management (the UI update) provides a clear, end-to-end implementation path."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Loading, Error States, and UI Polish",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the 'Loading, Error States, and UI Polish' task. Create subtasks for: 1. Integrating skeleton components using Next.js Suspense for the initial loading of the conversation history and message list. 2. Implementing robust error handling for all major API interactions (chat, history, deletion), displaying user-friendly error messages or toasts. 3. Conducting a final UI/UX polish and accessibility review, adding necessary ARIA labels, ensuring proper focus management, and refining visual details.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity comes from its breadth, as it touches almost every part of the user-facing application. It's about enhancing robustness and user experience. Separating the work into handling loading states, error states, and general polish allows for focused effort on each of these critical UX pillars."
